# VAutocomplete Infinite Scroll Component

This repository provides a Vue 3 component using Vuetify 3 that extends the VAutocomplete functionality with infinite scrolling capabilities. The component allows users to search for and select items from a dynamically loaded list, ideal for applications with large datasets where loading all items at once is impractical.

## Features

- **Infinite Scrolling**: As users scroll, additional data is fetched and appended to the list, ensuring smooth and continuous scrolling.
- **Dynamic Search**: The component updates the search results in real time based on user input.
- **Loading Indicators**: Visual feedback is provided to inform users when more data is being loaded or when all data has been loaded.
- **Intersection Observer**: Efficient data fetching is achieved using the Intersection Observer API to detect when the user reaches the end of the list.
- **Clearable Selection**: Users can easily clear their selection, resetting the search and list state.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YoussefAMansour/VAutocomplete-Infinite-Scroll-Single-Select
